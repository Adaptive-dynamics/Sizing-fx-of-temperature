Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the {IPCC}) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

However, projections of climate impacts will require a better mechanistic understanding of ecological and behavioral responses to climate change and climate variation. For vertebrate animals, there is an absence of whole-system manipulative experiments that express natural variation in predator and prey behaviors. Here we investigate the effect of elevated water temperature on the physiology, behavior, growth, and survival of fish populations in a multiple whole-lake experiment, by using 17 lake-years of data collected over 2 years with differing average temperatures. We found that elevated temperatures in excess of the optimum reduced the scope for growth through reduced maximum consumption and increased metabolism in young rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Increased metabolism at high temperatures resulted in increased feeding activity (consumption) by individuals to compensate and maintain growth rates similar to that observed at cooler (optimum) temperatures. However, greater feeding activity rates resulted in greater vulnerability to predators that reduced survival to only half that of the cooler year. Our work therefore identifies temperature-dependent physiology and compensatory feeding behavior as proximate mechanisms for substantial climate-induced mortality in fish populations at the scale of entire populations and waterbodies.},

Mean maximum metabolic rate, induced by swimming to exhaustion, Rmax(i), was 1223 (s.d., 157) mg O2, kg−1 h−1 for individuals. Standard metabolic rate, Rs. was 364 mg O2 kg−1 h−1, as estimated by extrapolating to zero activity from measurements of unfed, spontaneously active individuals. Mean routine metabolic rate, Rrout, of individuals was 421 (s.d., 58) mg O2, kg-1 h-1. The mean voluntary maximum metabolic rate, Rmax(v), following transfer of minimally exercised fish to the respirometer, was 1110 (s.d., 83) mg O2 kg −1 h−1 for groups of six fish, and was not significantly different from the value measured for individuals, 1066 (s.d., 122) mg O2, kg−1 h−1. Grouped fish acclimated to the respirometer more slowly than individual fish and exhibited significantly higher Rrout, apparently a result of greater social interaction and activity in groups. Mean Rrout for groups was 560 (s.d., 78) mg O2, kg−1 h−1. While groups of zebrafish fed a ration of 5\% wet body weight day−1 exhibited consistently higher metabolic rates than fish fed rations of 2.5\% wet body weight day−1 the high ration group still used only a maximum of 77\% of the metabolic scope. Zebrafish of the size studied do not appear to demonstrate a high degree of conflict in utilization of metabolic scope by different respiratory components. The metabolic rates measured for zebrafish are among the highest yet measured for fish of similar size and at similar temperatures.},

By making a number of assumptions it is possible to calculate the oxygen consumed by the cardiac and branchial pumps at all levels of activity. The maximum oxygen uptake is predicted to occur when oxygen supply to the tissues is optimal. At 15 °C the predicted maximum is eight to ten times the resting oxygen consumption and both the cardiac and branchial pumps make a significant contribution in limiting oxygen supply to the tissues. Although changes in resting efficiency from those assumed and in percentage utilization of oxygen from the water and blood affect the relative contribution of the cardiac and branchial pumps in limiting tissue oxygen supply, the predicted maximum oxygen uptake is little changed. The predicted maximum oxygen uptake compares favourably with data reported in the literature for salmonids. Several factors may have an effect on the results of this type of analysis. Consequently, in the Discussion, an attempt is made to assess the effects of an increase in body weight and whether increases or decreases in temperature will affect the relation between the cardiac and branchial pumps in limiting oxygen supply to the tissues.},

Our study examined oxygen uptake and delivery in resting, swimming and recovering sockeye salmon while water temperature was acutely increased from 15°C to 24°C in 2°C h–1 increments. Fish swam at a constant speed during the temperature change. By simultaneously measuring oxygen consumption ( Ṁ O2), cardiac output ( Q̇ ) and the blood oxygen status of arterial and venous blood, we were able to determine where in the oxygen cascade a limitation appeared when fish stopped sustained swimming as temperature increased. High temperature fatigue of swimming sockeye salmon was not a result of a failure of either oxygen delivery to the gills or oxygen diffusion at the gills because oxygen partial pressure ( P O2) and oxygen content ( C O2) in arterial blood did not decrease with increasing temperature, as would be predicted for such limitations. Instead, arterial oxygen delivery ( T {aO}2) was initially hampered due to a failure to adequately increase Q̇ with increasing temperature. Subsequently, lactate appeared in the blood and venous P O2 remained constant.},

	abstract = {Several recent studies have highlighted how impaired cardiac performance at high temperatures and in hypoxia may compromise the capacity for oxygen transport. Thus, at high temperatures impaired cardiac capacity is proposed to reduce oxygen transport to a degree that lowers aerobic scope and compromises thermal tolerance (the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance ({OCLTT}) hypothesis). To investigate this hypothesis, we measured aerobic and cardiac performance of a eurythermal freshwater teleost, the European perch (Perca fluviatilis). Rates of oxygen consumption were measured during rest and activity at temperatures between 5°C and 27°C, and we evaluated cardiac function by in vivo measurements of heart rate and in vitro studies to determine contractility of myocardial strips. Aerobic scope increased progressively from 5°C to 21°C, after which it levelled off. Heart rate showed a similar response. We found little difference between resting and active heart rate at high temperature suggesting that increased cardiac scope during activity is primarily related to changes in stroke volume. To examine the effects of temperature on cardiac capacity, we measured isometric force development in electrically paced myocardial preparations during different combinations of temperature, pacing frequency, oxygenation and adrenergic stimulation. The force-frequency product increased markedly upon adrenergic stimulation at 21 and 27°C (with higher effects at 21°C) and the cardiac preparations were highly sensitive to hypoxia. These findings suggest that at (critically) high temperatures, cardiac output may diminish due to a decreased effect of adrenergic stimulation and that this effect may be further exacerbated if the heart becomes hypoxic. Hence cardiac limitations may contribute to the inability to increase aerobic scope at high temperatures in the European perch (Perca fluviatilis).},

	abstract = {One important aspect of climate change is the increase in average temperature, which will not only have direct physiological effects on all species but also indirectly modifies abundances, interaction strengths, food-web topologies, community stability and functioning. In this theme issue, we highlight a novel pathway through which warming indirectly affects ecological communities: by changing their size structure (i.e. the body-size distributions). Warming can shift these distributions towards dominance of small- over large-bodied species. The conceptual, theoretical and empirical research described in this issue, in sum, suggests that effects of temperature may be dominated by changes in size structure, with relatively weak direct effects. For example, temperature effects via size structure have implications for top-down and bottom-up control in ecosystems and may ultimately yield novel communities. Moreover, scaling up effects of temperature and body size from physiology to the levels of populations, communities and ecosystems may provide a crucially important mechanistic approach for forecasting future consequences of global warming.},

However, such mechanistic approaches combining warming effects on metabolic (energy loss of organisms) and feeding rates (energy gain by organisms) remain a key, yet elusive, goal. Aiming to fill this void, we studied the metabolic rates and functional responses of three differently sized, predatory ground beetles on one mobile and one more resident prey species across a temperature gradient (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 °C). Synthesizing metabolic and functional-response theory, we develop novel mechanistic predictions how predator–prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional responses) should respond to warming. Corroborating prior theory, warming caused strong increases in metabolism and decreases in handling time. Consistent with our novel model, we found increases in predator attack rates on a mobile prey, whereas attack rates on a mostly resident prey remained constant across the temperature gradient. Together, these results provide critically important information that environmental warming generally increases the direct short-term per capita interaction strengths between predators and their prey as described by functional-response models. Nevertheless, the several fold stronger increase in metabolism with warming caused decreases in energetic efficiencies (ratio of per capita feeding rate to metabolic rate) for all predator–prey interactions. This implies that warming of natural ecosystems may dampen predator–prey oscillations thus stabilizing their dynamics. The severe long-term implications; however, include predator starvation due to energetic inefficiency despite abundant resources.},

We then interpret K in terms of the {VBGE} in mass , and show that the previous equation is itself equivalent to a −⅓ power function rule between M and the mass at first reproduction (Wα); this new −⅓ power function emerges directly from the life history that maximizes Darwinian fitness in non-growing populations. We merge this M, Wα power function with other power functions to produce general across-species scaling rules for yearly reproductive allocation, reproductive effort and age at first reproduction in fish. We then suggest a new way to classify habitats (or lifestyles) as to the life histories they should contain, and we contrast our scheme with the widely used Winemiller–Rose fish lifestyle classification.},

	abstract = {Balanced harvesting, where species or individuals are exploited in accordance with their productivity, has been proposed as a way to minimize the effects of fishing on marine fish communities and ecosystems. This calls for a thorough examination of the consequences balanced harvesting has on fish community structure and yield. We use a size- and trait-based model that resolves individual interactions through competition and predation to compare balanced harvesting with traditional selective harvesting, which protects juvenile fish from fishing. Four different exploitation patterns, generated by combining selective or unselective harvesting with balanced or unbalanced fishing, are compared. We find that unselective balanced fishing, where individuals are exploited in proportion to their productivity, produces a slightly larger total maximum sustainable yield than the other exploitation patterns and, for a given yield, the least change in the relative biomass composition of the fish community. Because fishing reduces competition, predation and cannibalism within the community, the total maximum sustainable yield is achieved at high exploitation rates. The yield from unselective balanced fishing is dominated by small individuals, whereas selective fishing produces a much higher proportion of large individuals in the yield. Although unselective balanced fishing is predicted to produce the highest total maximum sustainable yield and the lowest impact on trophic structure, it is effectively a fishery predominantly targeting small forage fish.},

A large female produces a higher quantity of eggs than a young female because of its larger size, but recent laboratory evidence further indicates that large females also produce eggs of higher quality, a phenomenon known as maternal effects. However, most traditional management models assume that all female fish contribute equally per unit biomass to future recruitment. Here we investigate whether this assumption is valid by calculating the impact of maternal effects both before and after accounting for density-dependent effects. We find that the contribution of large individuals to reproduction is much more pronounced for unfished than for fished stocks. Fisheries reference points are largely unaffected by maternal effects. Our results indicate that the incorporation of maternal effects into impact..., La pêche entraîne des modifications drastiques de la structure par âge et par taille des stocks de poissons.

Trophic interactions between such species vary throughout life, resulting in different species-level interaction motifs depending on the maximum adult sizes and population size distributions. We explore the assembly and potential for coexistence of small communities where all species experience ontogenetic trophic niche shifts. The life-history of each species is described by a physiologically structured model and species identity is characterised by the trait: size at maturation. We show that a single species can exist in two different states: a ‘resource driven state’ and a ‘cannibalistic state’ with a large scope for emergent Allee effects and bistable states. Two species can coexist in two different configurations: in a ‘competitive coexistence’ state when the ratio between sizes at maturation of the two species is less than a predator–prey mass ratio and the resource level is low to intermediate, or in a ‘trophic ladder’ state if the ratio of sizes at maturation is larger than the predator–prey mass ratio at all resource levels. While there is a large scope for coexistence of two species, the scope for coexistence of three species is limited and we conclude that further trait differentiation is required for coexistence of more species-rich size-structured communities.},

	abstract = {We employ size-based theoretical arguments to derive simple analytic predictions of ecological patterns and properties of natural communities: size-spectrum exponent, maximum trophic level, and susceptibility to invasive species. The predictions are brought about by assuming that an infinite number of species are continuously distributed on a size–trait axis. It is, however, an open question whether such predictions are valid for a food web with a finite number of species embedded in a network structure. We address this question by comparing the size-based predictions to results from dynamic food web simulations with varying species richness. To this end, we develop a new size- and trait-based food web model that can be simplified into an analytically solvable size-based model. We confirm existing solutions for the size distribution and derive novel predictions for maximum trophic level and invasion resistance. Our results show that the predicted size-spectrum exponent is borne out in the simulated food webs even with few species, albeit with a systematic bias. The predicted maximum trophic level turns out to be an upper limit since simulated food webs may have a lower number of trophic levels, especially for low species richness, due to structural constraints. The size-based model possesses an evolutionary stable state and is therefore un-invadable. In contrast, the food web simulations show that all communities, irrespective of number of species, are equally open to invasions. We use these results to discuss the validity of size-based predictions in the light of the structural constraints imposed by food webs.},

How community ecology links natural mortality, growth, and production of fish populations. – {ICES} Journal of Marine Science, 66: 1978–1984. Size-spectrum theory is used to show that (i) predation mortality is a decreasing function of individual size and proportional to the consumption rate of predators; (ii) adult natural mortality M is proportional to the von Bertalanffy growth constant K; and (iii) productivity rate P/B is proportional to the asymptotic weight W∞−1/3. The constants of proportionality are specified using individual level parameters related to physiology or prey encounter. The derivations demonstrate how traditional fisheries theory can be connected to community ecology. Implications for the use of models for ecosystem-based fisheries management are discussed.},

	abstract = {Warming of the oceans and consequent loss of dissolved oxygen (O2) will alter marine ecosystems, but a mechanistic framework to predict the impact of multiple stressors on viable habitat is lacking. Here, we integrate physiological, climatic, and biogeographic data to calibrate and then map a key metabolic index—the ratio of O2 supply to resting metabolic O2 demand—across geographic ranges of several marine ectotherms. These species differ in thermal and hypoxic tolerances, but their contemporary distributions are all bounded at the equatorward edge by a minimum metabolic index of {\textasciitilde}2 to 5, indicative of a critical energetic requirement for organismal activity. The combined effects of warming and O2 loss this century are projected to reduce the upper ocean’s metabolic index by {\textasciitilde}20\% globally and by {\textasciitilde}50\% in northern high-latitude regions, forcing poleward and vertical contraction of metabolically viable habitats and species ranges.
Double trouble
It is well known that climate change will warm ocean waters, but dissolved oxygen levels also decrease as water warms. Deutsch et al. combined data on metabolism, temperature, and demographics to determine the impact of marine deoxygenation on a variety of fish and crustacean species (see the Perspective by Kleypas). Predicted climate and oxygen conditions can be expected to contract the distribution of marine fish poleward, as equatorward waters become too low in oxygen to support their energy needs. Furthermore, even the more-poleward waters will have reduced oxygen levels.

Since the number of environmental variables and regulatory processes is large, straightening out the environmental influences on fish performance is intractable unless the mechanistic analysis of the ‘fish-milieu’ system is preceded by an understanding of the properties of that system. While revisiting the key points in our currently poorly integrated understanding of fish ecophysiology, we have highlighted the explanatory potential contained within Fry's (Fry 1947 Univ. Toronto Stud. Biol. Ser. 55, 1–62) concept of metabolic scope and categorization of environmental factors. These two notions constitute a pair of powerful tools for conducting an external (at the emerging property level) analysis of the environmental influences on fish, as well as an internal (mechanistic) examination of the behavioural, morphological and physiological processes involved. Using examples from our own and others work, we have tried to demonstrate that Fry's framework represents a valuable conceptual basis leading to a broad range of testable ecophysiological hypotheses.},

We emphasise that marine management has to accommoyear ‘shifting baselines’ caused by climate change particularly during {GEnS} monitoring, assessment and management and ‘unbounded boundaries’ given the migration and dispersal of highly-mobile species.

	doi = {10.1093/conphys/cow007},
	abstract = {Repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits is increasingly a focus for animal researchers, for which fish have become important models. Almost all of this work has been done in the context of evolutionary ecology, with few explicit attempts to apply repeatability and context dependency of trait variation toward understanding conservation-related issues. Here, we review work examining the degree to which repeatability of traits (such as boldness, swimming performance, metabolic rate and stress responsiveness) is context dependent. We review methods for quantifying repeatability (distinguishing between within-context and across-context repeatability) and confounding factors that may be especially problematic when attempting to measure repeatability in wild fish. Environmental factors such temperature, food availability, oxygen availability, hypercapnia, flow regime and pollutants all appear to alter trait repeatability in fishes. This suggests that anthropogenic environmental change could alter evolutionary trajectories by changing which individuals achieve the greatest fitness in a given set of conditions. Gaining a greater understanding of these effects will be crucial for our ability to forecast the effects of gradual environmental change, such as climate change and ocean acidification, the study of which is currently limited by our ability to examine trait changes over relatively short time scales. Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative traits, which so far lag behind measures of repeatability of behavioural traits.},

Metabolic rate is commonly described to scale as a power function of body size and exponentially with temperature, thereby treating the effects of body size and temperature independently. Mounting evidence shows that the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass itself depends on temperature. Across-species analyses in fishes suggest that the mass-scaling exponent decreases with increasing temperature. However, whether this relationship holds at the within-species level has rarely been tested. Here, we re-analyse data on the metabolic rates of four freshwater fish species, two coregonids and two cyprinids, that cover wide ranges of body masses and their naturally experienced temperatures. We show that the standard metabolic rate of the coregonids is best fit when accounting for a linear temperature dependence of the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass, whereas a constant mass-scaling exponent is supported in case of the cyprinids. Our study shows that phenotypic responses to temperature can result in temperature-dependent scaling relationships at the species level and that these responses differ between taxa. Together with previous findings, these results indicate that evolutionarily adaptive and phenotypically plastic responses to temperature affect the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass in fishes.},

However, food intake rate generally is assumed to vary as Wd, where d = 2/3, an assumption based on observations from feeding trials in laboratory studies. Further, the von Bertalanffy growth function ({VBGF}) is specifically integrated using this assumption. We argue that when considered from an ecological perspective, d is highly uncertain, dependent on how swimming speed, reactive distance, and prey biomass varies ontogenetically with the growth of a predator. Incorrectly specifying d leads to incorrect predictions of consumption and metabolism, especially at younger ages that are typically under-sampled. Three alternate means of detecting departures from d = 2/3 are provided, the most promising of which involves fixing initial length of the generalized {VBGF} to the length at endogenous feeding and directly calculating von Bertalanffy parameters (L∞, K, t0).

Abstract
Metabolic energy fuels all biological processes, and therefore theories that explain the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass potentially have great predictive power in ecology. A new model, that could improve this predictive power, postulates that the metabolic scaling exponent (b) varies between 2/3 and 1, and is inversely related to the elevation of the intraspecific scaling relationship (metabolic level, L), which in turn varies systematically among species in response to various ecological factors. We test these predictions by examining the effects of lifestyle, swimming mode and temperature on intraspecific scaling of resting metabolic racTcTte among 89 species of teleost fish. As predicted, b decreased as L increased with temperature, and with shifts in lifestyle from bathyal and benthic to benthopelagic to pelagic. This effect of lifestyle on b may be related to varying amounts of energetically expensive tissues associated with different capacities for swimming during predator–prey interactions.},

The rate of synthesis is described as a function of food taken, of the efficiencies of digestion and energy conversion, and of the absorbing surface of the intestine. Catabolic processes are supposed to be functions of the oxygen concentration in the water, the absorbing surface of the gills, and the rate of oxygen transport.

	title = {Models projecting the fate of fish populations under climate change need to be based on valid physiological mechanisms},
	
	
	abstract = {Some recent modelling papers projecting fish sizes and catches in a warmer future are based on erroneous assumptions regarding 1) the scaling of gills with body mass and 2) the energetic cost of ‘maintenance’. Assumption 1) posits that insurmountable geometric constraints prevent respiratory surface areas from growing as fast as body volume. It is argued that these constraints explain allometric scaling of energy metabolism, whereby larger fish have relatively lower mass specific metabolic rates. Assumption 2) concludes that when fish reach a certain size, basal oxygen demands will not be met, because of assumption 1). We here demonstrate unequivocally, by applying accepted physiological principles with reference to existing literature, that these assumptions are not valid. Gills are folded surfaces, where the scaling of surface area to volume is not constrained by spherical geometry. The gill surface area can, in fact, increase linearly in proportion to gill volume and body mass. We cite the large body of evidence demonstrating that respiratory surface areas in fishes reflect metabolic needs, not vice versa, which explains the large interspecific variation in scaling of gill surface areas. Finally, we point out that future studies basing their predictions on models should incorporate exponents for scaling of metabolic rate and for temperature effects on metabolism, which agree with measured values, and should account for interspecific variation in scaling and temperature effects. It is possible that some fishes will become smaller in the future but to make reliable predictions the underlying mechanisms need to be identified and sought elsewhere than in geometric constraints on gill surface area. Furthermore, to ensure that useful information is conveyed to the public and policymakers about the possible effects of climate change, it is necessary to improve communication and congruity between fish physiologists and fisheries scientists.

Physiological individual-based modelling of larval Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) foraging and growth: insights on climate-driven life-history scheduling. – {ICES} Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1170–1188.A physiological individual-based model for the foraging and growth of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae was constructed, valiyeard using laboratory and field data, tested for parameter sensitivity, and used to examine climate-driven constraints on life-history scheduling. Model scenarios examined how natural (phenological and magnitude) changes in key environmental factors (temperature, prey, and photoperiod/daylength) affected the estimates of survival and growth of spring- and autumn-spawned larvae. The most suitable hatching seasons agreed well with the periods of larval abundance in Northeast Atlantic waters. Modelled survival is unlikely in June, July, and November. Mean annual temperature, prey concentration, and composition significantly influenced larval growth of both autumn and spring spawners. The model suggested that climate-driven changes in bottom-up factors will affect spring- and autumn-spawned larvae in different ways. It is unlikely that autumn-spawning herring will be able to avoid unfavourable conditions by delaying their spawning time or by utilizing more northern spawning grounds because of limitations in daylength to larval growth and survival. Conversely, earlier spawning in spring, or later, midsummer spawning will be tightly constrained by match–mismatch dynamics between larvae and zooplankton production.},

Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative traits, which so far lag behind measures of repeatability of behavioural traits.},

	abstract = {Use of stable isotope ratios to trace pathways of organic matter among consumers requires knowledge of the isotopic shift between diet and consumer. Variation in trophic shift among consumers can be substantial. For data from the published literature and supplementary original data (excluding fluid-feeding consumers), the mean isotopic shift for C was +0.5±0.13‰ rather than 0.0‰, as commonly assumed. The shift for C was higher for consumers analyzed as muscle (+1.3±0.30‰) than for consumers analyzed whole (+0.3±0.14‰). Among consumers analyzed whole, the trophic shift for C was lower for consumers acidified prior to analysis (−0.2±0.21‰) than for unacidified samples (+0.5±0.17‰). For N, trophic shift was lower for consumers raised on invertebrate diets (+1.4±0.21‰) than for consumers raised on other high-protein diets (+3.3±0.26‰) and was intermediate for consumers raised on plant and algal diets (+2.2±0.30‰). The trophic shift for S differed between high-protein (+2.0±0.65‰) and low-protein diets (-0.5±0.56‰). Thus, methods of analysis and dietary differences can affect trophic shift for consumers; the utility of stable isotope methods can be improved if this information is incorporated into studies of trophic relationships. Although few studies of stable isotope ratios have considered variation in the trophic shift, such variation is important because small errors in estimates of trophic shift can result in large errors in estimates of the contribution of sources to consumers or in estimates of trophic position.},

Nevertheless, here we find that most shallow water marine species occupy broad thermal distributions that are aggregated in either temperate or tropical realms. These distributional trends result in ocean-scale spatial thermal biases, where communities are dominated by species with warmer or cooler affinity than local environmental temperatures. We use community-level thermal deviations from local temperatures as a form of sensitivity to warming, and combine these with projected ocean warming data to predict warming-related loss of species from present-day communities over the next century. Large changes in local species composition appear likely, and proximity to thermal limits, as inferred from present-day species’ distributional ranges, outweighs spatial variation in warming rates in contributing to predicted rates of local species loss.},

	abstract = {Effects of global warming on animal distribution and performance become visible in many marine ecosystems. The present study was designed to develop a concept for a cause and effect understanding with respect to temperature changes and to explain ecological findings based on physiological processes. The concept is based on a wide comparison of invertebrate and fish species with a special focus on recent data obtained in two model species of fish. These fish species are both characterized by northern and southern distribution limits in the North Atlantic: eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), as a typical non-migrating inhabitant of the coastal zone and the cod (Gadus morhua), as a typical inhabitant of the continental shelf with a high importance for fisheries.

Mathematical modelling demonstrates a clear significant correlation between climate induced temperature fluctuations and the recruitment of cod stocks. Growth performance in cod is optimal at temperatures close to 10°C, regardless of the population investigated in a latitudinal cline. However, temperature specific growth rates decrease at higher latitudes. Also, fecundity is less in White Sea than in North and Baltic Sea cod or eelpout populations. These findings suggest that a cold-induced shift in energy budget occurs which is unfavorable for growth performance and fecundity. Thermal tolerance limits shift depending on latitude and are characterized by oxygen limitation at both low or high temperatures. Oxygen supply to tissues is optimized at low temperature by a shift in hemoglobin isoforms and oxygen binding properties to lower affinities and higher unloading potential. Protective stimulation of heat shock protein synthesis was not observed.

According to a recent model of thermal tolerance the downward shift of tolerance limits during cold adaptation is associated with rising mitochondrial densities and, thus, aerobic capacity and performance in the cold, especially in eurythermal species. At the same time the costs of mitochondrial maintenance reflected by mitochondrial proton leakage should rise leaving a lower energy fraction for growth and reproduction. The preliminary conclusion can be drawn that warming will cause a northern shift of distribution limits for both species with a rise in growth performance and fecundity larger than expected from the Q10 effect in the north and lower growth or even extinction of the species in the south. Such a shift may heavily affect fishing activities in the North Sea.},

As temperature directly affects physiological rates, it is clear that a mechanistic understanding of species vulnerability should be grounded in organismal physiology. Here, we review what respiratory physiology can offer the field of thermal ecology, showcasing different perspectives on how respiratory physiology can help explain thermal niches. In water, maintaining adequate oxygen delivery to fuel the higher metabolic rates under warming conditions can become the weakest link, setting thermal tolerance limits. This has repercussions for growth and scaling of metabolic rate. On land, water loss is more likely to become problematic as long as O2 delivery and {pH} balance can be maintained, potentially constraining species in their normal activity. Therefore, high temperatures need not be lethal, but can still affect the energy intake of an animal, with concomitant consequences for long-term fitness. While respiratory challenges and adaptive responses are diverse, there are clear recurring elements such as oxygen uptake, {CO}2 excretion, and water homeostasis. We show that respiratory physiology has much to offer the field of thermal ecology and call for an integrative, multivariate view incorporating respiratory challenges, thermal responses, and energetic consequences.

Thus, these sub-lethal responses to extreme temperatures potentially shape evolution of thermal performance curves. We applied a quantitative genetic model and found that beneficial acclimatization and cumulative damage alter the extent to which thermal performance curves evolve in response to thermal extremes. The impacts of extremes on the evolution of thermal performance curves are reduced if extremes cause substantial mortality or otherwise reduce fitness differences among individuals. Further empirical research will be required to understand how responses to extremes aggregate through time and vary across life stages and processes.

The concept of oxygen- and capacity-dependent thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained climate-induced effects of rising temperatures on species abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress, caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope. Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on a limited temperature range results from temperature-dependent trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors like {CO}2 (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual analysis suggests that the relationships between energy turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus, community responses at the ecosystem level.},

	abstract = {Previous projection of climate change impacts on global food supply focuses solely on production from terrestrial biomes, ignoring the large contribution of animal protein from marine capture fisheries. Here, we project changes in global catch potential for 1066 species of exploited marine fish and invertebrates from 2005 to 2055 under climate change scenarios. We show that climate change may lead to large-scale redistribution of global catch potential, with an average of 30–70\% increase in high-latitude regions and a drop of up to 40\% in the tropics. Moreover, maximum catch potential declines considerably in the southward margins of semienclosed seas while it increases in poleward tips of continental shelf margins. Such changes are most apparent in the Pacific Ocean. Among the 20 most important fishing Exclusive Economic Zone ({EEZ}) regions in terms of their total landings, {EEZ} regions with the highest increase in catch potential by 2055 include Norway, Greenland, the United States (Alaska) and Russia (Asia). On the contrary, {EEZ} regions with the biggest loss in maximum catch potential include Indonesia, the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), Chile and China. Many highly impacted regions, particularly those in the tropics, are socioeconomically vulnerable to these changes. Thus, our results indicate the need to develop adaptation policy that could minimize climate change impacts through fisheries. The study also provides information that may be useful to evaluate fisheries management options under climate change.},

In this study we report on the feeding, growth, behaviour and conversion-efficiency of 0 + Atlantic cod in response to water temperature and food availability. In one experiment, activity, opercular beat and growth decreased with decreasing temperature over the range 8·3–0·6° C. However, the conversion efficiency increased with decreasing temperature, a result partly explained by the relative change in activity and opercular rate. In another experiment, temperature had a linear effect on growth in cod fed different food rations. Both food availability and temperature were found to influence growth in group 0 + cod. The specific growth rate of cod in this experiment exceeded 2\% day-1. Growth data collected from cod sampled in the field during the cold-water period showed a progressive increase of mean length over the season. Overall, these results demonstrate that 0 + cod have adapted to life in cold-water environments, in contrast to adult cod which mostly inhabit warmer environments.},

	abstract = {In the coming decades, environmental change like warming and acidification will affect life in the ocean. While data on single stressor effects on fish are accumulating rapidly, we still know relatively little about interactive effects of multiple drivers. Of particular concern in this context are the early life stages of fish, for which direct effects of increased {CO}2 on growth and development have been observed. Whether these effects are further modified by elevated temperature was investigated here for the larvae of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), a commercially important fish species. Over a period of 32 days, larval survival, growth in size and weight, and instantaneous growth rate were assessed in a crossed experimental design of two temperatures (10°C and 12°C) with two {CO}2 levels (400 μatm and 900 μatm {CO}2) at food levels mimicking natural levels using natural prey. Elevated temperature alone led to increased swimming activity, as well as decreased survival and instantaneous growth rate (Gi). The comparatively high sensitivity to elevated temperature in this study may have been influenced by low food levels offered to the larvae. Larval size, Gi and swimming activity were not affected by {CO}2, indicating tolerance of this species to projected "end of the century" {CO}2 levels. A synergistic effect of elevated temperature and {CO}2 was found for larval weight, where no effect of elevated {CO}2 concentrations was detected in the 12°C treatment, but a negative {CO}2 effect was found in the 10°C treatment. Contrasting {CO}2 effects were found for survival between the two temperatures. Under ambient {CO}2 conditions survival was increased at 12°C compared to 10°C. In general, {CO}2 effects were minor and considered negligible compared to the effect of temperature under these mimicked natural food conditions. These findings emphasize the need to include biotic factors such as energy supply via prey availability in future studies on interactive effects of multiple stressors.},

With sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) as an example, the optimal cruising and foraging speeds were found to be proportional to the body length raised to the 0.4 power. By analogy, if pelagic fish in general tend to move at either of these speeds, their ration and growth rates relative to the body weight should be proportional to a power that varies between 0.7 and 0.8. These predictions are consistent with field growth measurements for several pelagic species. Therefore, the necessary conditions for a theory of optimal foraging exist since (1) all adaptive swimming speeds are physiologically possible and (2) there i..., Nous démontrons à partir de la théorie de l'hydrodynamique et de la répartition des tailles des particules dans les chaînes alimentaires marines qu'il existe deux vitesses de nage uniques jouant un rôle important chez les poissons pélagiques : (1) la vitesse optimale de croisière, portant au maximum la distance parcourue par unité d'énergie dépensée et (2) la vitesse optimale de quête de nourriture, portant au maximum le taux d'écoulement de surplus d'énergie, ou production au sens le plus large. Nous servant du saumon nerka (Oncorhynchus nerka) comme exemple, nous constatons que les vitesses optimales de croisière et de quête de nourriture sont proportionnelles à la longueur du corps élevée à la puissance 0.4. Par analogie, si les poissons pélagiques en général ont tendance à se déplacer à l'une ou l'autre de ces vitesses, leur ration et leur rythme de croissance par rapport au poids corporel devraient être proportionnels à une puissance comprise entre 0.7 et 0.8.

However, the metabolic scaling exponent (b) may vary with activity state, as has been shown chiefly for interspecific relationships. Here I use a meta-analysis of literature data to test whether b changes with activity level within species of ectothermic animals. Data for 19 species show that b is usually higher during active exercise (mean ± 95\% confidence limits = 0.918 ± 0.038) than during rest (0.768 ± 0.069). This significant upward shift in b to near 1 is consistent with the metabolic level boundaries hypothesis, which predicts that maximal metabolic rate during exercise should be chiefly influenced by volume-related muscular power production (scaling as M1). This dependence of b on activity level does not appear to be a simple temperature effect because body temperature in ectotherms changes very little during exercise.},
